# 🐩 Foster-Pet-Matching-System

This project is a Foster Pet Matching System that combines API data retrieval, web scraping, and a matching algorithm to provide accurate pet adoption recommendations. It extracts pet listings from the PetFinder API and enriches the dataset using The Dog API. The system also scrapes additional data from pet-related websites, cleans, and structures it for analysis. A matching algorithm is then applied to recommend pets based on user preferences, helping users find the most suitable pets for adoption.

## 🐶 Features  
### 🔹 API Data Retrieval  
- Extracts pet listings from **PetFinder API**, including breed, age, size, and adoption status.  
- Fetches dog breed details using **The Dog API** to enrich dataset attributes.  

### 🔹 Web Scraping  
- Uses `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to scrape additional data from pet-related websites.  
- Cleans and structures unstructured HTML content for analysis.  

### 🔹 Data Analysis & Visualization  
- Identifies adoption trends based on pet attributes.  
- Performs breed-based clustering and sentiment analysis using descriptive statistics and NLP.  
- Generates visualizations using **Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
